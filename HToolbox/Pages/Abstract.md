# Abstract
allReady is an open-source solution focused on increasing awareness, efficiency and impact of preparedness campaigns as they are delivered by humanitarian and disaster response organizations in local communities.

allReady is a sub project of Humanitarian Toolbox. its continuing mission, to harnnest the skills and capabilities of developers in order to maximize the value they deliver to society, or in their own words [[1]](http://www.htbox.org/about):

> A massive storm floods Manhattan - **and people need to find shelter quickly**.
> 
> Drought hits the Horn of Africa - **and smart delivery of food supplies saves lives**.
> 
> An earthquake rocks Mumbai - **and first responders need to know where to go minute by minute**.
> 
> Responding to disasters like these means boots on the ground—but we can help responders do more with less when we see them as coding challenges. Do you want to use your skills to do some good and learn along the way? Together a few sharp minds can save lives and make a real difference.

That's the mission of the Humanitarian Toolbox. We connect people like you with organizations in need of your expertise. You can build the next generation of life-saving tools and refine them to meet new needs as they arise.  We maintain and deploy this ‘toolbox’ of solutions quickly to get them in the hands of those making a difference. Everything we build is open-source and part of an open ecosystem so the tools can be adapted, integrated and deployed to particular situations as they evolve.

If you are a developer, software architect, database guru, designer, tester or software project manager, then sign up to be part of The Humanitarian Toolbox, a "volunteer army" of software experts willing to donate part of their expertise and time to help solve the technology issues that arise in enabling this open response community and help us develop the solutions required to support this community based response [[2]](http://blog.disasterexpert.org/2012/11/the-sandy-legacy.html)

In this chapter we will overview some aspects of the project including:
 1. Stakeholders analysis
 2. Challenges of the project
 3. Strategies of mainting an open source code base (including tests, CI, standartization etc...)
 And more...
