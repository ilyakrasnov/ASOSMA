The XS Configuration is a set of thresholds for "Fat" and "Tangles" at different levels of composition.
Fat indicates "too much stuff" in one place and is measurable at every level of composition - Design, Namespace, Class and Method.
Cyclomatic Complexity is used as a measure of Fat at the method level - the number of dependencies in the child dependency graph is used at the other levels.
For the purposes of XS, tangles are only measured at the design level, i.e. cyclic dependencies between namespaces.
Both Fat and Tangles are measured as the percentage by which the threshold is exceeded. This percentage is multiplied by the size of the item so that the Average XS can be read as a percentage of the code-base.
