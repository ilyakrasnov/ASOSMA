# General details about the project  #

![All Ready](https://github.com/HTBox/allReady/blob/04456b9816ce918376e12d99c78bf434a444fed8/docs/media/all-ready-project-banner.jpg)

Humanitarian Toolbox (HTBox) is a charity supporting disaster relief organizations with open source software and services.  
HTBox harnesses the skills of volunteer developers to contribute disaster relief aid through

1.	Creating apps that map the spread of disease
2.	maintaining software that helps to optimize the delivery of relief supplies
And more…

Humanitarian Toolbox has a goal of creating software and programs for relief organizations to have ready in times of need.
What makes HTBox unique is the focus on sustainability through the use of Open Source software. Developers want to give to charity using their skills – building software. 
There are other projects that build software solutions within a humanitarian organization during a crisis.  But, when the crisis is over, often the people involved in creating it move on or the software languishes on the shelf. Instead of deteriorating, HTBox takes on these projects so they can be maintained and ready for future usage.

#	project fit for our book (why it was chosen?) #
The Constrains were:  
 1. Interesting to you - It was indirectly followed by one of the team members for several years (via podcast - [.net rocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com) e.g. [episode 808](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=808)  )
 2. Big & complex enough - This is rather hard to quantify - but [contributers](https://github.com/HTBox/allReady/graphs/contributors), [commits](https://github.com/HTBox/allReady/graphs/commit-activity) and [issues](https://github.com/HTBox/allReady/issues) implies it meets the requierment
 3. Actively developed on github ([>700 PRs in last year](https://github.com/HTBox/allReady/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20%20created%3A2016-01-01..2017-12-12))
 4. [Has Unit tests](https://github.com/HTBox/allReady/tree/04456b9816ce918376e12d99c78bf434a444fed8/AllReadyApp/Web-App/AllReady.UnitTest). According to the docs [All projects have some unit tests.](http://htbox.github.io/building-the-project.html).
 5. Commonly used by disaster relief organizations [[1](http://solutionscenter.nethope.org/case_studies/view/humanitarian-toolbox-visual-studio-online-used-to-energize-and-optimize-cro)]  
 
 On the down side, is does not seem to be missing documenation on first glance.  
 
 One last plus - it has a [welcoming introduction for new contributers](https://github.com/HTBox/allReady#how-you-can-help) [[1](https://github.com/HTBox/allReady/wiki/Solution-architecture)]


#	Describe the model of the development process (more in stage 2) #

1. [an episode about HTBox](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=808) is avialable ([.net rocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com))

#	Add a few images or diagrams to support the above #
