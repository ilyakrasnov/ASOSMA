# General details about the project  #

Humanitarian Toolbox (HTBox) is a charity supporting disaster relief organizations with open source software and services.  
HTBox harnesses the skills of volunteer developers to contribute disaster relief aid through

1.	Creating apps that map the spread of disease
2.	maintaining software that helps to optimize the delivery of relief supplies
And more…

Humanitarian Toolbox has a goal of creating software and programs for relief organizations to have ready in times of need.
What makes HTBox unique is the focus on sustainability through the use of Open Source software. Developers want to give to charity using their skills – building software. 
There are other projects that build software solutions within a humanitarian organization during a crisis.  But, when the crisis is over, often the people involved in creating it move on or the software languishes on the shelf. Instead of deteriorating, HTBox takes on these projects so they can be maintained and ready for future usage.
